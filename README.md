# FlickrFindr

A simple application that uses the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to display the most recently uploaded photos to the platform. Users can then use the search bar to search for photos using specific queries.

Implemented in SwiftUI + MVVM. No third party dependencies used. 
 
**IMPORTANT**: before running the project please insert your API key in the `.xcconfig` file [here](./Config.xcconfig).
